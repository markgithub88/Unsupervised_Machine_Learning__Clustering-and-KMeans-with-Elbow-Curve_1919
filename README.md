19.0.4 Unsupervised Learning
Key differences we studied.
In unsupervised learning, there are two key differences from the above approach:

There are no paired inputs and outcomes.
The model uses a whole dataset as input.
Unsupervised learning is used in two ways.  Transform the data to create an intuitive representation for analysis or to use in another machine learning model, or cluster or determine patterns in a grouping of data, rather than to predict a classification.
